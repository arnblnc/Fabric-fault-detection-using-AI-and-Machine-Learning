If you want to test the object detector, you can do it in three ways:
	- Open  Evaluate.mlx and run the first three lines of code
	- Or a create new live editor and load trainingDetector.mat and run the line of code: 
		detectionResults = detect(trainingDetector,testData);
	- Or open TestingImages.mlx, load imdsTest and change the value of n between the values of 1-270

To recreate the program from scratch like methodology, run the following .mlx files in order:
	1) Database
	2) Network
	3) Data_Augmentation
	4) Train_Network
